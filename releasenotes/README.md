# Release Notes: Fix for DOCX Text Extraction

## Summary
This release fixes a critical bug where text content from `.docx` files was not being extracted and returned by the `/extract` endpoint. The issue was caused by a missing variable assignment, which led to a `500 Internal Server Error`.

## Changes
- **Bug Fix:** Corrected the logic in `app.py` to properly assign the output of `extract_text_from_docx` to the `extracted_text` variable.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improved the `extract_text_from_docx` function in `text_extractors.py` to specifically catch errors related to corrupted or invalid DOCX files, returning a more informative error message.
- **API Response:** The API now correctly returns a `200 OK` with the extracted text for valid DOCX files and a `500 Internal Server Error` for corrupted files, as per the acceptance criteria.

## Technical Details

### DOCX Extraction Logic Fix
The bug was fixed by properly assigning the return value from the `extract_text_from_docx` function to the `extracted_text` variable in the `/extract` endpoint:

```python
# Before
elif file_extension == 'docx':
    # Bug: Missing variable assignment
    extract_text_from_docx(filepath)

# After
elif file_extension == 'docx':
    # Fixed: Correctly assign the return value
    extracted_text = extract_text_from_docx(filepath)
```

### Error Handling Enhancement
The `extract_text_from_docx` function was enhanced to catch specific exceptions related to corrupted DOCX files:

```python
try:
    doc = Document(docx_path)
    # ... extraction logic ...
    return text.strip()
except PackageNotFoundError:
    # Specific handling for corrupted or malformed DOCX files
    raise ValueError("Error processing file: The DOCX file is corrupted or invalid.")
except Exception as e:
    # Generic error handling for other exceptions
    raise ValueError(f"An unexpected error occurred while processing the DOCX file: {str(e)}")
```

### API Response Improvement
The `/extract` endpoint was updated to catch and handle these specific exceptions:

```python
try:
    # ... extraction logic ...
except ValueError as ve:
    # Specific handling for ValueError (including corrupted DOCX files)
    return jsonify({'filename': filename, 'extracted_text': '', 'error': str(ve)}), 500
except Exception as e:
    # Generic error handling
    return jsonify({'filename': filename, 'extracted_text': '', 'error': f'Error processing file: {str(e)}'}), 500
```

## Benefits
- Improved reliability for DOCX text extraction
- Better error messages for troubleshooting
- Consistent API response structure
- Enhanced system stability when processing invalid files
